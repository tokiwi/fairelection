Elisa Celis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi/Home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nisheeth K. Vishnoi</a> (currently at Yale). The framework is based on linear programming, making it possible to determine the list of winners while taking into account both preselected criteria and the raw results of an election. Visually speaking, we can picture each possible list in our problem as a point on a relief map. The optimal solution that the model and algorithm seek is the point that is situated highest on this map. With the help of linear programming, instead of examining each point individually (which would be too time consuming), we can take a step back, discern the overall geometry of the scope of possibilities in question, mark the highest regions, and then focus on the points in these regions during our investigation. In this way, we are eventually able to identify the highest point. This method enjoys the decisive advantage of mathematically guaranteeing that the recommended solution is indeed the best one. The scientific publication describing this approach is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10057.pdf\">available here</a>.",
