# FairElection client setup

**1) Download dependencies**

Make sure you have [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
and then run:

```
npm install
```

**2) Build and serve the app**

To start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
ng serve
```

In your browser, open http://localhost:4200/ to see the new app run. You may have to adapt the
apiUrl configuration in **environments/environment.ts** to the url served by **symfony serve** command.
